Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI Homework Helper App (Web-Based MVP)
1. Overview
The AI Homework Helper App is a web-based tool designed to empower middle and high school students (ages 12‚Äì18) with homework support across math, science, writing, and summary tasks. Students can upload photos üì∏ or type/paste text ‚å®Ô∏è to receive strategic hints, concept explanations, practice tasks, and post-test quizzes to reinforce learning. The app avoids providing full answers to ensure it‚Äôs teacher-approved, focusing on guiding students to understand and solve tasks independently. Built for accessibility on any browser, it features a dark-mode, emoji-friendly interface to feel modern and engaging. The MVP prioritizes simplicity, speed (<3-second responses), and light gamification to drive daily use. üéØ
Goal: Enable students to input a task ‚Üí get a hint üí°, learn the concept üß†, practice üîÑ, and test knowledge ‚úÖ in a fun, web-based platform.

2. Feature Breakdown & Prioritization
Below, each feature is detailed with its functionality, technical requirements, and prioritization rationale to guide development focus. Priorities are ranked as High, Medium, or Low based on user value, feasibility, and MVP impact.
2.1 Flexible Input: Photo Upload or Text Entry üì∏‚å®Ô∏è

Function: Students upload a photo of a homework task (e.g., math equation, essay prompt, article) or type/paste text directly in the browser for processing.
Requirements:
Photo Upload: Drag-and-drop or "Choose File" button for JPEG/PNG images (<5MB). Use client-side OCR (e.g., Tesseract.js) or server-side API (e.g., Google Cloud Vision) to extract text/equations.
Text Entry: Text box for pasting or typing prompts, articles, or questions (max 2,000 characters).
Auto-detect subject: Math/science via equations (e.g., ‚Äú2x + 3 = 7‚Äù); writing via prompts (e.g., ‚ÄúWrite an essay on‚Ä¶‚Äù); summary via long text.
Display extracted/entered text for user confirmation.
Process inputs in <3 seconds with 80%+ OCR accuracy for handwritten/typed text.
Support Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge (latest versions) on desktop/mobile.


Technical Needs:
Frontend: React & Tailwind CSS
Backend: Tanstack Start for API handling; OCR integration (Tesseract.js for client-side or Google Cloud Vision for server-side).
NLP: Basic subject detection using regex for equations or keyword analysis for writing/summary.


Priority: High
Rationale: Input is the entry point for all user interactions. Without reliable photo/text input, other features can‚Äôt function. Photo upload is critical for math/science (core subjects), and text entry enables writing/summary tasks. Fast, accurate input sets the ‚Äúmagical‚Äù tone and drives adoption.


Development Notes: Start with client-side OCR (Tesseract.js) to minimize costs, but plan for a server-side API (e.g., Google Cloud Vision) for better accuracy. Subject detection can use simple rules (e.g., equations ‚Üí math; ‚Äúessay‚Äù ‚Üí writing) to keep MVP lean.

2.2 Hint Mode üí°

Function: Provide a concise, subject-specific hint to guide students without giving full answers, tailored to math, science, writing, or summary tasks.
Requirements:
Math/Science: E.g., for ‚ÄúSolve: 2x + 3 = 7‚Äù, hint: ‚ÄúTry isolating x by subtracting 3 from both sides.‚Äù
Writing: E.g., for ‚ÄúEssay on climate change‚Äù, hint: ‚ÄúStart with a surprising fact, then outline 3 points: causes, effects, solutions.‚Äù
Summary: E.g., for an article, hint: ‚ÄúFocus on the main thesis and 2 key points‚Äîaim for 1/4 the original length.‚Äù
Hints are 1‚Äì2 sentences, avoiding direct solutions.
Tone: Friendly, e.g., ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs tricky but fun! Here‚Äôs a hint üéØ.‚Äù
Generate hints in <2 seconds after input confirmation.


Technical Needs:
AI: Lightweight NLP/math parser (e.g., fine-tuned GPT or rule-based logic for math; keyword-based templates for writing/summary).
Backend: API endpoint to process input and return hint.
Frontend: Display hint in a clean, emoji-enhanced card.


Priority: High
Rationale: Hints are the core value proposition, guiding students across subjects without cheating. They ensure the app feels helpful and teacher-approved, driving engagement. This feature is critical for all task types and aligns with the learning-focused mission.


Development Notes: Use rule-based templates for math/science hints (e.g., ‚Äúisolate variable‚Äù for equations) and pre-defined patterns for writing/summary to minimize AI complexity. Consider xAI‚Äôs Grok API for advanced NLP if budget allows (details at https://x.ai/api).

2.3 Concept Breakdown üß†

Function: Explain the underlying concept or technique for the task to deepen understanding.
Requirements:
Math/Science: E.g., ‚ÄúThis is a linear equation. Use inverse operations to isolate the variable, like balancing a scale! ‚öñÔ∏è‚Äù
Writing: E.g., ‚ÄúA thesis statement summarizes your essay‚Äôs main point in one sentence. It‚Äôs the heart of your argument! üí°‚Äù
Summary: E.g., ‚ÄúSummarizing means capturing key ideas in fewer words. Look for topic sentences and skip minor details. ‚úÇÔ∏è‚Äù
Explanations are 2‚Äì3 sentences with analogies/emojis.
Display in <2 seconds after user selection.


Technical Needs:
AI: Pre-built concept database (e.g., ‚Äúlinear equations‚Äù ‚Üí explanation) or lightweight NLP for dynamic generation.
Frontend: Show explanation in a visually distinct section (e.g., collapsible card).


Priority: Medium
Rationale: Concept explanations enhance learning by teaching why a solution works, but they‚Äôre secondary to hints, which provide immediate help. Students may skip this feature if in a rush, so it‚Äôs not as critical as input or hints but still adds significant value for retention.


Development Notes: Use a static database of common concepts (e.g., 50 math/science topics, 10 writing/summary techniques) to reduce AI dependency. Map inputs to concepts via keywords or equation types.

2.4 Practice Mode üîÑ

Function: Generate similar tasks for students to practice and reinforce skills.
Requirements:
Math/Science: E.g., Original: ‚ÄúSimplify: 3(2x - 5)‚Äù; Practice: ‚ÄúSimplify: 4(3x - 2).‚Äù
Writing: E.g., Original: ‚ÄúEssay on pollution‚Äù; Practice: ‚ÄúOutline an essay on recycling‚Äîlist 3 key points.‚Äù
Summary: E.g., Provide a 150-word passage to summarize in 50 words.
Offer 1‚Äì3 practice tasks with a ‚ÄúCheck Feedback‚Äù option (e.g., for writing: ‚ÄúYour outline is solid‚Äîadd more evidence!‚Äù).
Tone: Fun, e.g., ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs practice this skill! Ready? üöÄ‚Äù
Generate tasks in <2 seconds.


Technical Needs:
AI: Template-based task generator (e.g., tweak numbers for math; swap topics for writing).
Backend: API to generate and validate practice tasks.
Frontend: Input field for answers; feedback display.


Priority: Medium
Rationale: Practice mode reinforces learning and adds value beyond homework help, but it‚Äôs less critical than input and hints, which are the app‚Äôs core. Students may not always use practice tasks, but it‚Äôs key for engagement and skill-building.


Development Notes: Use simple templates (e.g., change coefficients for math; swap keywords for writing prompts) to keep generation lightweight. Feedback can be rule-based (e.g., check math answers exactly; flag missing outline points).

2.5 Post-Test Mode ‚úÖ

Function: Offer a quick 3‚Äì5 question quiz to recap knowledge after a task.
Requirements:
Generate multiple-choice or short-answer questions:
Math: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the next step in 3x = 9? A) Add 3 B) Divide by 3.‚Äù
Writing: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a hook? A) Conclusion B) Attention-grabber.‚Äù
Summary: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the main idea of this passage? A) Details B) Thesis.‚Äù


Provide instant feedback: ‚ÄúCorrect! üéâ‚Äù or ‚ÄúClose‚Äîreview the concept üß†.‚Äù
Tie to the original task; generate in <2 seconds.
Optional: Save scores to progress tracker.


Technical Needs:
AI: Rule-based quiz generator (e.g., map math steps to options; use writing/summary templates).
Frontend: Simple quiz UI with radio buttons/text input and feedback pop-ups.


Priority: Low
Rationale: Post-tests solidify learning and add gamification, but they‚Äôre less essential than input, hints, or practice. Students may skip quizzes under time pressure, but this feature boosts retention and engagement for dedicated users.


Development Notes: Use a small question bank tied to concepts (e.g., 5 questions per topic) to minimize AI load. Feedback can be static (e.g., correct/incorrect) for simplicity.

2.6 Progress Tracker üìä

Function: Track student activity across subjects to encourage daily use.
Requirements:
Log: Tasks attempted, hints used, practice tasks completed, quizzes passed (e.g., ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve tackled 2 math problems and 1 quiz! ü•≥‚Äù).
Display a simple dashboard with subject breakdowns.
Store data in browser local storage (no login required).
Accessible via a ‚ÄúProgress‚Äù tab.


Technical Needs:
Frontend: React component for dashboard (e.g., bar chart or text stats).
Storage: Browser localStorage API for persistence.


Priority: Low
Rationale: Progress tracking adds stickiness through gamification, but it‚Äôs not core to solving homework. It‚Äôs a nice-to-have that encourages return visits but can be simplified (e.g., basic stats) to avoid delaying MVP launch.


Development Notes: Use localStorage to store JSON with task counts; display as a simple list or chart. Avoid complex metrics in MVP.
